hello! and welcome to your first edition of npm's Open Source Weekly.

# product roadmap notes

at the product meeting this week, we talked about some key things:

## npm and Node.js LTS 

currently, there's 💬talk💬 of some potential 🙅blockers🙅 to 
shipping new verisons of npm with Node.js and Node.js LTS. 
specifically there is concern around the deprecation of an API
that npm depends on. changing this would mean that future
versions of npm would not be backwards compatible with other 
Node.js versions (npm is backwards compatible all the way to
[Node.js 0.8] 😱).

[Node.js 0.8]: https://github.com/npm/npm/blob/master/.travis.yml#L8

## green all the tests 💚💚💚

a lot of bug and product work has been on hold as we work to get
travis green. while this is definitely frustrating given that we
have several 🐛big bugs🐛 and some 🌟key feature requests 🌟 we'd 
like to get to, greening our tests is an 💰investment💰 we're
making now so that we can be extra 🔒safe🔒 and 💃productive💃
later. it will also make it way easier to accept PRs from the
public! 👯

## windows! 🔥💻🔥

we are currently running CI via travis to test npm on *nix based
machines, but we're well aware that a 📚comprehensive📚 testing
solution will also require CI for Windows. we're looking into
adding Appveyor, or a similar product, to our stack so we can
get the same 💪testing guarantees💪 we have for *nix for Windows
systems. (yes, npm 💞 Windows)

## performance 🏃🏆🏃

we hear you, and we agree: npm3 wants to be 💥faster💥. just as
soon as we get travis and windows green, we'll be focusing on 
bringing npm3's performance up to where npm2's currently is.

# feature-request triage notes

we've been spending a very deliberate 30min every day triaging 
feature requests from the community. you may have noticed the new
[`already-looked-at` label], which we are using to help keep
track of our progress. here's some general notes about what we've
been seeing and saying:

## run scripts

people want more with run scripts, and we hear that. however,
it is important to the team that we keep the functionality of
run scripts primarily conventional; that is implementations that
allow for significant configuration are not something we'll
ever accept; we'll leave such funcationality to grunt, gulp,
broccoli, or whatever's coming next.

that being said, there are definitely somethings we'd like to 
do to improve the scripts feature. a key trouble we've noticed
is the frustrating `npm build` vs `npm run build`, and it's 
something we are planning to improve.

[`already-looked-at` label]: 

## browser/custom dep lists



## a note on better feature request issues

we care about ya'll and def want to hear your suggestions! a 
way we can improve our communication is to focus on your needs
as users and *not* the technical implementation. when you file
a feature request, it would be super helpful if you gave detail
about what you were trying to accomplish, in what environment,
and for what purpose. the implementation is a secondary detail!

# patches welcome!

did you know that we 💌 you? we know we can't get to every good
feature request that we receive, but we do know all ya'll are
✨awesome.✨ we're closing all feature-requests we can't reasonably
achieve in the next 6 months, but we are using the `patches welcome`
[label] to mark things we'd happily see contributed by the community.
take a look, send us some notes, make a patch!

some neat ones from this week include:
